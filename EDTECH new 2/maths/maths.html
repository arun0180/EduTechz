    <div id="addition" class="content">
        <h2><u>Addition</u></h2>
        <p>Addition is one of the basic arithmetic operations used to combine two or more numbers to find their total or sum. It is often represented by the plus sign (+).<br> 
            <br><b>Key points about addition:</b><br> 
            <br><b>Operands: </b>The numbers that are being added are called "addends."<br>
            <br><b> Result:</b> The result of addition is called the "sum."<br>
            <br><b>Example:</b><br>
            <br>If you add 3 and 5, you write it as:<br>
            3+5=8<br>
            Here, 3 and 5 are the addends, and 8 is the sum.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="subtraction" class="content">
        <h2><u>Subtraction</u></h2>
        <p> Subtraction is one of the basic arithmetic operations, represented by the minus sign ("-"). It involves taking one number (called the subtrahend) away from another number (called the minuend), to find the difference between the two.<br>
            
           <br> For example, in the subtraction problem: <br>
            8−3=5<br>
            
            <br><b>Minuend:</b> 8 (the number from which something is being subtracted)<br>
            <br><b>Subtrahend:</b> 3 (the number being subtracted)<br>
            <br> <b>Difference:</b> 5 (the result of the subtraction)<br>
            <br><b>Key Points:</b><br>
            <br><b>Order Matters:</b> In subtraction, the order in which the numbers are arranged matters. Changing the order will change the result.<br>
            
            8−3=5
            <br><br>
            <b>Negative Results: </b>If the number being subtracted is larger than the number it is subtracted from, the result will be negative. For example:
            3−8=−5
            <br><br>
            <b>Subtraction of Zero:</b> Subtracting zero from any number leaves the number unchanged.
            
            5−0=5</p>
    </div>

    <div id="multiplication" class="content">
        <h2><u>Multiplication </u></h2>
        <hp>Multiplication is one of the basic operations in arithmetic and mathematics. It is essentially repeated addition. When you multiply two numbers, you are adding one number to itself repeatedly a certain number of times.
<br><br>
           <b>Key Concept:</b> 
            If you multiply two numbers, for example, 4 and 3, it means you are adding the number 4 three times.
            
            So, 4 × 3 is the same as: 
            
            4+4+4=12
            <br><br>
           <b>Multiplication Terminology:</b> 
            <br><br>
            <b>Multiplicand:</b> The number being multiplied (in the example, 4).
            <br><br>
            <b>Multiplier:</b> The number by which the multiplicand is multiplied (in the example, 3).
            <br><br>
            <b>Product:</b> The result of the multiplication (in the example, 12).
            Example:
            Let's take a simple example:
            5 × 2
            <br><br>
            This means adding 5 two times:<br>
            5+5=10<br>
            So, the product of 5 and 2 is 10.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="division" class="content">
        <h2><u>Division</u></h2>
        <p>Division is one of the basic operations in arithmetic, and it is essentially the process of splitting or sharing something into equal parts. In division, you take a number (the dividend) and divide it by another number (the divisor) to find out how many times the divisor fits into the dividend. The result is called the quotient.
<br><br>
           <b>Key Terminology:</b> <br><br>
            <b>Dividend:</b> The number you are dividing (the total amount you want to split).
            <br><br> <b>Divisor:</b> The number by which you are dividing the dividend (the number of parts or groups).
            <br><br> <b>Quotient:</b> The result of the division (how many times the divisor fits into the dividend).
            <br><br>  <b>Remainder:</b> The part left over after division, when the dividend is not perfectly divisible by the divisor.
            <br><br>   <b> Basic Division:</b>
                         For example, if you have 12 ÷ 3, you're asking, "How many times does 3 fit into 12?"
            
            Dividend: 12
            Divisor: 3
            Quotient: 4 (because 3 fits into 12 exactly 4 times).
            So,
            
           <br>
            12÷3=4</p>
    </div>

    <div id="geometry" class="content">
        <h2><u>Geometry</u></h2>
        <p>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, relative positions of figures, and properties of space. Here are some basic concepts in geometry:
<br><br>
           <b>1. Points:</b>
            <br>*A point represents a location in space.<br> It has no length, width, or thickness—just position.
            <br>*Typically labeled with capital letters like A, B, C.
            <br><br><b>2. Lines:</b>
            <br>*A line is a one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions.
            <br>*A line segment is a part of a line with two endpoints.
            <br>*A ray starts at one point and extends infinitely in one direction.
            <br>*Lines can be parallel (never intersect), perpendicular (intersect at a right angle), or skew (don't intersect and aren't parallel).
            <br><br><b>3. Angles:</b>
            <br>*An angle is formed by two rays (or line segments) that share a common endpoint, called the vertex.
            <br>*Acute angle: less than 90°
            <br>*Right angle: exactly 90°
            <br>*Obtuse angle: greater than 90° but less than 180°
            <br>*Straight angle: exactly 180°
            <br><br><b> 4. Triangles:</b>
            <br>*A triangle is a polygon with three sides.

            <br>*Scalene triangle: All sides have different lengths.
            <br>*Right triangle: One of the angles is exactly 90°.
            <br>*Acute triangle: All angles are less than 90°.
            <br>*Obtuse triangle: One angle is greater than 90°.
            <br><br>
            <b>5. Circles:</b>
            <br>*A circle is the set of all points equidistant from a center point.
            <br>*Radius: The distance from the center to any point on the circle.
            <br>*Diameter: A line segment passing through the center, connecting two points on the circle. The diameter is twice the length of the radius.
            <br>*Circumference: The perimeter or boundary of the circle.
            <br>*Area: The space inside the circle, given by the formula 
            <br>
            Area=πr 
            2<br>
             , where

            r is the radius.<br><br>
            <b>6. Polygons:</b><br>
            *A polygon is a closed figure made up of straight line segments.

            <br>*Quadrilateral: A four-sided polygon. Common types include:
            <br>*Square: All sides equal, all angles 90°.
            <br>*Rectangle: Opposite sides equal, all angles 90°.
            <br>*Parallelogram: Opposite sides equal and parallel.
            <br>*Rhombus: All sides equal, opposite angles equal.
            <br>*Trapezoid: One pair of sides parallel.<br><br>

        <h2><u>Algebra</u></h2>
        <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. <br>Here are some of the basic algebraic formulas and concepts that you should know:
<br><br>
            <b>1. Basic Arithmetic Formulas</b>
           <br> Addition: 
            a+b
           <br> Subtraction: 
            a−b
            <br>Multiplication: 
          
            a×b or 
            
            ab
            <br>Division: 
          <br>
            b
            a
            ​<br>
              (where,  
            𝑏
            ≠
            0
              )<br><br>
            <b>2. Distributive Property</b><br>
            The distributive property states that:
    <br>
            a(b+c)=ab+ac
            This is useful when multiplying a number by a sum or difference.
            <br><br><b>3. Solving Linear Equations</b> 
            <br>A basic linear equation is of the form:
            
            <br>
            ax+b=c<br>
            To solve for 
            
            x:
            
            <br>*Subtract 
          
            b from both sides:
            <br>ax=c−b
            <br>Divide both sides by 
            
            a: x= c-ba
            <br><br>
           <b>4. Quadratic Equation Formula</b>

            The solutions for 
         
            x can be found using the quadratic formula:<br>
            
            𝑥
